## Models and Main Package Versions
Trained random forest model can be found at: https://utexas.box.com/shared/static/epbzxav40e25orn3c2liie2e62mo39sn.pkl

### Versions
python3/3.6.3  
scikit-learn==0.18.1   


# Code
There are two scripts: *get_features.py*, and *predict.py*

get_features.py obtains features from synchronized mother baby data streams into one single file final.csv

Input format example: (time in second, acc value) in css file
0.1 23.12
0.2 43.12

predict.py predicts crying at seconds level, then smooth the predictions, then make the predictions into minute level.

RUN get_features.py, then predict.py
